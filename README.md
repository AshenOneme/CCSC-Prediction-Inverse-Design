*__This research introduces a method for predicting the mechanical performance and inverse design of Complex Cross-Sectional Columns (CCSCs) based on deep learning algorithms. A series of data-driven investigations were conducted from both forward prediction and inverse generation perspectives.__*

<!-- 流程图 -->
>## **_Workflow_**

In this work, to evaluate the effectiveness of the prediction and generation methods, a substantial dataset of column cross-sections is required. Currently, such an extensive database is not readily available. Therefore, the MNIST-Section dataset was developed based on the MNIST dataset by mapping handwritten digits to fiber cross-sections. Subsequently, OpenSeesPy was employed to perform the computations, resulting in a fiber model dataset comprising 70,000 columns.

The digit portions were mapped to steel, while the remaining portions were mapped to concrete. Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the proportion of steel in the cross-section and the strength degradation of the columns after loading, categorized into ten classes corresponding to the digits 0 through 9.

>## **_Prediction of the mechanical performance of CCSCs_**

The predictive model we developed, which maps column cross-sectional properties to mechanical performance, demonstrates robust predictive capabilities. In Figure 3, the **_blue_** line represents the results of numerical simulations, while the **_red_** line depicts the predicted results generated by the ViT model.

>## **_Transfer to more regular or more complex cross-sections_**

Although the dataset we utilized, MNIST-Section, lacks realism, the predictive model trained on this dataset is capable of accurately predicting the mechanical performance of both **_regular_** and **_more complex_**, non-standard cross-sections. The results, as shown in Figure 4, demonstrate the model's effectiveness even when applied to cross-sections that deviate from typical engineering scenarios.

>## **_DDPM for cross-section generation_**

Given the mechanical performance demands for the columns, the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) can rapidly generate corresponding cross-sectional forms. Each generated cross-section undergoes mechanical performance evaluation using OpenSeesPy, which is then compared against the specified performance criteria. It is observed that as the number of sampling steps increases, the resulting cross-sections become more regular, and the finite element analysis results progressively converge towards the target mechanical performance.
