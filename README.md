This research introduces a method for predicting the mechanical performance and inverse design of Complex Cross-Sectional Columns (CCSCs) based on deep learning algorithms. A series of data-driven investigations were conducted from both forward prediction and inverse generation perspectives.

<!-- 流程图 -->
>**_Workflow_**

In this work, to evaluate the effectiveness of the prediction and generation methods, a substantial dataset of column cross-sections is required. Currently, such an extensive database is not readily available. Therefore, the MNIST-Section dataset was developed based on the MNIST dataset by mapping handwritten digits to fiber cross-sections. Subsequently, OpenSeesPy was employed to perform the computations, resulting in a fiber model dataset comprising 70,000 columns.

The digit portions were mapped to steel, while the remaining portions were mapped to concrete. Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the proportion of steel in the cross-section and the strength degradation of the columns after loading, categorized into ten classes corresponding to the digits 0 through 9.

The predictive model we developed, which maps column cross-sectional properties to mechanical performance, demonstrates robust predictive capabilities. In Figure 3, the blue line represents the results of numerical simulations, while the red line depicts the predicted outcomes generated by the ViT model.
